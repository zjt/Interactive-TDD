watches for any changes in your development directory
and then runs a command, such as run your unit test suite
and outputs the results either to the terminal or to growl

How to use:
1. install 'interact' somewhere in your path
2. run 'interact' before you start developing and it will do its magic
3. pass in options to 'interact' as you see fit
